Here is how PQRST is determined:
1.
Signal is filtered with FIR and bandpass with cut-off frequency of 3â€“45 Hz.

2.
After the signal is filtered, R-peaks are detected by using Hamilton Segmenter.

3.
The number of R-peaks is next accumulated and divided by the recording time to obtain the heart-rate value in BPM (beats per minute).

4.
From each R-peaks point, Q point is obtained by detecting the lowest signal value in the interval of 80 ms before R point, while S point is obtained by detecting the lowest signal value in the interval of 80 ms after R point. Thus, QRS complex is obtained.

5.
P wave is obtained by detecting the highest signal value in the interval of 200 ms before Q point.

6.
T wave is obtained by detecting the highest signal value in the interval of 400 ms after S point.
